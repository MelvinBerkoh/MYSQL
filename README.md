This just goes over everything that I am trying to learn for my class CS -331 DATABASE MANAGAMENT AND DESIGN. In preparation for my final I am using a youtube tut 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA&t=4315s  to learn the language inside and out. Excerises will be put inside of the regular files.  ALl of my classwork will be added throughout
my course when i added it at a time. 

The objective of the course is to introduce modern database systems. It focuses on the following
issues: data models, conceptual data modes, the Entity-Relationship model, the Relational model,
formal database query languages, the Relational algebra, the standard database language SQL,
external hashing and indexing, formal database design theory, functional dependencies and
normal forms, and transaction processing. Students will get hands-on experience with modern
database management systems using the standard database language SQL.
